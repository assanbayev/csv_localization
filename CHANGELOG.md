## [0.6.0]
I don't manipulate the CSV file anymore, but you can set the prefered `eol` now
which defaults to `\n`.

## [0.5.0]
Decided to simplify the API again by removing the string extenstion `tr`.

This makes more sense if we want to use multiple localization libraries.

Moved `string_ext` to the `example` folder if you want to use it.

## [0.4.0]
- added CsvLocalizations.instance to avoid the need for a BuildContext
- added String extension getter 'tr'

- improve README 
- add multiline example

## [0.2.0+2]

- add rationale to README

## [0.2.0+1]

- tweak example and remove danish

## [0.2.0]

- simplify API to use a single `string` method. We don't want to pollute String with extensions
methods. Users can add (and name) these themselves as they see fit.
